\[A\] Actuality: “What we are managing to do now, with existing
resources, under existing constraints.”

\[C\] Capability: “This is what we could be doing (still right now) with
existing resources, under existing constraints, if we really worked at
it.”

\[Po\] Potentiality: “This is what we ought to be doing by developing
our resources and removing constraints, although still operating within
the bounds of what is already known to be feasible.”

\[La\] Latency

\[Pr\] Productivity

\[Pf\] Performance

Where:

\[A\] is the % value of blocks used, for example with 943,121 that is
9%: 12 \[C\] is an estimated value, where determined by Management: 50
\[P\] is the amount of transactions determined by gasBlockLimit that is
possible on the network: 135 \[Pr\] is the value of C/A, giving us
Productivity
