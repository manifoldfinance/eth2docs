# Network Variety in Ethereum 

> "The lethal variety attenuator is sheer ignorance."
>  - Stafford Beer

Variety grows exponentially with the size of organisations and major
systems, creating vast amounts of complexity with regards to its
interactions. Some real-world systems have levels of variety which are
effectively infinite. However, our perceptions attenuate (“filter-out”)
any variety which is irrelevant to what we are trying to observe.

Operations - elements that do things. (Infrastructure & Software)
Management - elements that control operations. (Protocol) & Governance)
Environment - the surroundings within which the other elements function.
(Price and Ethereum Main Network)

The VBSM is an implementation of the Viable Systems Model for
decentralized blockchain networks with an emphasis on autonomy,
viability, and stability

In reaching a viable state, defined terms and sub-systems must be
formalized and specified. This section of the documentation is an effort in
trying to formalize such goals, objectives and key results that can be
achieved when a systems-based approach is combined with formal design
and mechanisms to achieve said goals.
