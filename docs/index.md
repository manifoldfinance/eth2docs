# The Viable Node Model 

The Viable Nodel Model is an implementation of the Viable Systems Model for
decentralized blockchain networks.

It prioritizes and emphasizes:

- Autonomy
- Viability
- Stability

## Reading this documentation

- Guides, for broad hands-on understanding and connections to other learning resources
- Tutorials, intended to teach a particular process or project
- Cookbooks, collections of tips and tricks
- Reference, full manuals and technical coverage
- Pedias, for encyclopedic description

+ If information is more encyclopedic (with a similar scope and tone to pages on Wikipedia), a page would be considered a medium.
+ If information is less encyclopedic and more similar to a compendium, study guide, or bibliographic guide, a page would be considered a guide.
+ If information is more about direct instruction to achieve a specific task, a page would be considered a tutorial.
+ If a page is more just a set of tips and tricks (less instructive than a tutorial), it would be a cookbook.
+ If a page is a detailed reference (like a man page or full software manual), it would fit under references.

### Style 

Example: 
The verb 'own' can be stative. If 'owning' describes a state, change the sentence structure and use the base form of the verb.

## Network Variety in Ethereum

Variety grows exponentially with the size of organisations and major
systems, creating vast amounts of complexity with regards to its
interactions. Some real-world systems have levels of variety which are
effectively infinite. However, our perceptions attenuate (“filter-out”)
any variety which is irrelevant to what we are trying to observe.

- Operations - elements that do things. (Infrastructure & Software)
- Management - elements that control operations. (Protocol) & Governance)
- Environment - the surroundings within which the other elements function.(Price and Ethereum Main Network)

In reaching a viable state, defined terms and sub-systems must be
formalized and specified. This section of the documentation is an effort in
trying to formalize such goals, objectives and key results that can be
achieved when a systems-based approach is combined with formal design
and mechanisms to achieve said goals.
