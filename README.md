### [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/)

> A systematic framework for technical documentation authoring. <br /> The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation <br /> ‚ÄîDavid Laing

The Di√°taxis framework aims to solve the problem of structure in technical documentation. It adopts a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users in their cycle of interaction with a product.

> **Note** <br /> The name Di√°taxis comes from the Ancient Greek Œ¥·øê·æ∞ÃÅœÑ·æ∞Œæ·øêœÇ: dia (‚Äúacross‚Äù) and taxis (‚Äúarrangement‚Äù).

Di√°taxis identifies four modes of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanations. It derives its structure from the relationship between them.

In Di√°taxis, each of these modes (or types) answers to a different user need, fulfills a different purpose and requires a different approach to its creation.
